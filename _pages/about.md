    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>
      I'm currently pursuing a <strong>B.S./M.S. in Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Georgia Tech</strong>, specializing in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Modeling/Simulations. I recently worked at Amazon, where I built a scalable backend service for AI-driven market research, and will be joining Meta as a Software Engineer Intern this summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests and experience lie in designing and optimizing full-stack applications, cloud-native architectures, and distributed systems. My technical stack includes <strong>Python, C++, AWS/Cloud Technologies, React, and SQL</strong>, with a strong focus on backend performance and data processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently a Teaching Assistant for <strong>CS 3600: Intro to Artificial Intelligence</strong> under Prof. Riedl/Ma.

      Outside of technology, I love watching old movies, (amateurly) playing the piano, and lifting weights.
