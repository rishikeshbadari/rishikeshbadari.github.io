About Me
======

I'm currently pursuing a B.S./M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Modeling/Simulations. I recently worked at Amazon, where I built a scalable backend service for AI-driven market research, and will be joining Meta as a Software Engineer Intern this summer.

My interests and experience lie in designing and optimizing full-stack applications, cloud-native architectures, and distributed systems. My technical stack includes Python, C++, AWS/Cloud Technologies, React, and SQL, with a strong focus on backend performance, API scalability, and data processing. 

I'm currently a Teaching Assistant for CS 3600: Intro to Artificial Intelligence under Prof. Riedl/Ma. 

Outside of technology, I love watching old movies (LetterBoxd is linked), (amateurly) playing the piano, and learning about all kinds of influential art.
